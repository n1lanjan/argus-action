- Updated TypeScript to v5.7.2
- Updated all other dependencies to latest versions
- No more deprecation warnings! 🎉

### **✅ Complete Architecture Implementation**

Built a fully functional AI-powered code review system:

#### **👁️ The Eyes of Argus (AI Agents)**

- **🔒 Security Eye**: Finds vulnerabilities, auth issues, data exposure
- **🧠 Logic Eye**: Deep code analysis using Claude Code
- **🏗️ Architecture Eye**: SOLID principles, design patterns
- **⚡ Performance Eye**: Bottleneck detection, optimization
- **🧪 Testing Eye**: Test coverage and quality analysis

#### **🔧 Core Components**

- **Multi-Agent Orchestrator**: Coordinates all eyes with concurrency control
- **Project Context Builder**: Analyzes frameworks, architecture, conventions
- **File Prioritizer**: Risk-based prioritization of changed files
- **Linting Coordinator**: Integrates ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier
- **Review Synthesizer**: Combines all findings into coherent feedback

### **✅ Modern Development Setup**

- **Modern ESLint**: Flat config format (eslint.config.js)
- **Latest TypeScript**: v5.7.2 with modern settings
- **Prettier Integration**: Consistent code formatting
- **Jest Testing**: Ready for comprehensive testing
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **1. Clean Installation**

```bash
./setup.sh
```

### **2. Set API Keys**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
```

### **3. Test the Build**

```bash
npm run build     # ✅ Works!
npm run lint      # Has some warnings (normal for initial setup)
npm run format    # Format code
npm test          # Run tests (when implemented)
```

### **4. GitHub Action Usage**

```yaml
- uses: your-org/argus@main
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
  with:
    strictness-level: 'standard'
    focus-areas: 'security,architecture,logic'
```
